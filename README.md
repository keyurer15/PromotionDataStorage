   iii) Run "go get github.com/gobwas/ws/wsutil"
   iv)  Run "go build"
   v)   if the build shows no error, run "go run ." to start PromotionService
3) Go inside the DataStoreService folder and start CLI ( command line interface)
   i)   Run "go mod init main"
   ii)  Run "go get github.com/gobwas/ws"
